# Stock-Prediction

Developed a machine learning model to predict the future stock prices, specifically High, Low, and Close values, based on the current Open price and recent historical data. The system uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to capture sequential patterns in the stock market data. It processes normalized historical stock prices and outputs denormalized predictions in their original scale for practical use.

The project demonstrates proficiency in handling time-series data, pre-processing, and deploying deep learning models for financial forecasting.
